You will be rewarded with a deeper insight into the local livelihoods and unique traditions of Laos. \n\nYour guide will pick you up at your hotel in Vientiane (0900 or 1400). \n\nThe drive to Buddha Park takes around 45 minutes, along a road which serves as an important link between the Lao capital and Thailand. On the way, stop and take photos of the Friendship Bridge which was built by the Australian government in 1994 and links Laos and Thailand. \n\nArrive at Buddha Park and enjoy a stroll around the park. Also known as Xieng Khuan, this unusual park is filled with over 200 Buddhist and Hindu statues. The quiet and tranquil setting along the Mekong River is a contrast to the slightly eccentric sculptures which were built in 1958 by a Lao shaman. The concrete sculptures are bizarre but intriguing, sitting majestically in the peaceful park. \n\nAfter visiting Buddha Park, start the drive back to Vientiane. En route, stop at Mai Savanh to explore the traditional textiles of the Lao people.

Travel up the Mekong River to the Buddha-filled caves of Pak Ou, visit a local rice-wine making village, and visit a local ethnic minority village. Swim in the waters of the Kuang Si falls and meet endangered bears as you relax in the Laos countryside.\n\nThis morning you will be picked up from your hotel and transferred to a pier on the Mekong River for a private boat ride up the River.\n\nLaos has several waterways that have traditionally been used as the local form of transportation and they continue to be used in that manner today in many parts of the country. Taking a local boat cruise is certainly the most rewarding ways to discover the life along the rivers. As you cruise along, observe the daily activities of fishermen, how they throw their nets in elegant arm gestures, and rely on the water for their livelihood. For the villages settled along the Mekong, the river plays an important role in their daily life and usually represents the only means of transportation and commerce.\n\nTwo hours upstream from Luang Prabang, disembark to visit the famous Pak Ou Caves. Locally called Tam Ting, the caves are filled with thousands of gold-lacquered Buddha statues. The statues range in size from a few centimeters tall to the height of a human and are crammed into the cave which is nestled in a limestone cliff. The caves are a destination for local pilgrimages, especially around Pi Mai (Lao New Year, during April).\n\nAfter visiting the caves, reboard the boat for a cruise back to Luang Prabang. En route, stop at Ban Xang Hay, a village which specializes in making traditional rice-wine.\n\nLunch at Tamarind (included). Run by an Australian woman and her Lao husband, they have created a fresh menu of Lao dishes and are dedicated to promoting a greater understanding of the local cuisine.\n\nTake a short transfer through the LuangPrabang countryside to Kuang Si Waterfalls (32km southwest of the city). Along the way, you will drive through beautiful landscapes of rice fields, hills, and small villages. There are also viewpoints overlooking the Mekong River.\n\nStop en-route to visit a small village which is home to one of the area’s many ethnic minorities. You will have an opportunity to learn about their traditions and culture, much of which has remained unchanged for centuries.\n\nUpon reaching Kuang Si Waterfall, relax and enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings. The water tumbles down a large drop and cascades gently in toseveral cool, clear pools where you can enjoy a refreshing swim (please dress modestly).\n\nFor the adventurous, it is possible to walk to the top of the falls via a steep track where stunning views await you at the top.\n\nYou might also like to visit the bear sanctuary which is next to the falls, run by Free The Bears Fund Inc. There are currently 23 Asiatic Black Bears living in the sanctuary, which has saved them from poaching. The main threat to these bears is poaching due to the use of their bile in Chinese medicine. You can read about their habits and observe their playful nature, whilst learning about the difficulties they are facing.\n\nAfter leisurely time at the waterfalls, transfer back to your hotel in LuangPrabang.\n\nTime: 09.00 – 17.00\nDeparture: Daily\n\nOur services include:\n- Transport in a private air-conditioned vehicle .\n- 1 English Speaking Guide (for other languages supplements apply).\n- Meals as mentioned (L= Lunch).\n-All entrance fees as mentioned.\n- All permissions and local taxes\n- Drinking water\n\nOur services do not include:\n- Alcoholic drinks &amp; drinks at mealtime .\n- Personal travel insurance .\n- Tips for guideand driver.\n- Visa\n- Personal expenses\n- Meals other than those mentioned above\n- Other services not clearly indicated in the Package Inclusion above","durationSlots":2,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2dfjffdr6z60za/5.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CIT","localityName":"Central"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":13,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":12,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"34892LAO","productOptCode":"LPQPKEXOLPQFDPKEG","rank":15,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Overland journeys","Beach","Multi-generational","Honeymoon"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"6161LAO","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"6161LAO","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"FD Pak Ou Cave &amp; Kuang Si","voucherName":"EXO Travel Luang Prabang"}}

Lao food shares many characteristics with the more famous flavours from neighbouring Thailand, but also combines them with influences from approximately 160 different ethnic groups who contribute to the complex ethnology of Laos. \nThis tour starts in the mid-afternoon and runs in to the evening. The focus is on food, but this is also a fascinating insight in to the culture of Vientiane and Laos as a whole. \n\nYour private driver and guide will collect you from your hotel at around 15:45 for a short transfer to Lam Pai-Bay Tong. This is a rustic restaurant/cookery school down a quiet side street close to the Mekong River. The experienced Head Chef, Chandra, will begin the cooking class at 16:00. \n\nOver the next three hours you will learn how to create seven local dishes using traditional ingredients and techniques. There is no need to take notes because you will be given your own recipe book to take home, enabling you to recreate your favourites and remember your time in Laos for years to come. \n\nAt around 19:00 it will be time to relax and enjoy the feast which you have created together. Local desserts will also be on offer, although you will probably not make them yourself as the savoury dishes tend to be most popular. Tea, coffee and local herbal cocktails (non-alcoholic) are included. There is also a fully stocked bar if you wish to order anything else (not included). \n\nIt will be time to say farewell to Chandra at around 20:00 and take a leisurely walking tour with your guide. Stroll through Chao Anou Park and the Night Market, observing locals and taking in the views. Both are on the banks of the Mekong and this area is most appealing at night. Adventurous foodies can sample a huge range of local snacks along the way, with your guide on hand to explain what you are eating (or you might not want to know!). Your guide can also recommend places to end the day with a drink. Options include chic wine bars and lively karaoke bars which are popular with locals, or you might prefer to simply pull up a plastic chair and enjoy a Beerlao on the street (drinks and snacks are not included). \n\nYou can be transferred back to your hotel at around 21:00, or you might prefer to be dropped off at one of our recommended bars to continue your night. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: \nNote 1: Minimum group size is 1 pax. Maximum group size is 15 pax. Groups of up to 6 pax will do the course in the restaurant itself. Groups of 7-15 pax will do the course in a garden away from the city centre. If booking for less than 15 pax then please expect the cooking class to be on a join-in basis. \n\nNote 2: The Exotissimo guide will not accompany clients during the cookery class, unless requested.

This first temple used to be the Kings’ favorite temple to retreat when he needed to get away from the court’s hassles.\n\nFurther along the way, you can admire the Royal Vat Long Khoun, with its unique inner mural paintings.

On the way to the secret Hoy Khoua waterfall (Note: for agricultural purposes, and related to abundance of rain during rainy season, the waterfall can be dry at periods), we will stop along at a Khmu village to meet the elders and have a close up experience on their daily environment and lifestyle.\n\nAs we stop at Ban Pak Leuang, this time a Hmong village, we will board our private boat to cruise upstream to Ban Chan. The village is renowned in the region for its pottery making. Admire a young man work the clay into a small bowl, and visit the underground kilns which are used to cook hundreds of jars at a time. These ancestral methods are transferred, from one generation to another and require patience and dexterity.

Alms giving, the Kuang Si Waterfalls, rural villages and a cruise on the Mekong River will appear in many itineraries and are certainly highlights of any trip to Laos. With a little extra thought we feel that this tour offers a far greater experience of rural Laos. The picnic breakfast is perfect for a celebration or just a great treat!\n\nYour driver and guide will meet you at your hotel around 5:30am for a very special dawn visit to watch the monks collecting alms in the old streets of central Luang Prabang. As the sun begins to rise, long lines of orange-robed monks leave their pagodas and walk barefoot down the streets collecting offerings from Luang Prabang residents. This humbling daily ritual is a beautiful and powerful symbol of Buddhism which highlights the spirituality of the people of Laos. Your guide is on hand to answer any questions relating to Buddhism and to help you to avoid the streets where tourists are most numerous.\n\nIf you wish to stop for refreshments before the next leg of your journey then just ask your guide. You will travel by road for 40-45 minutes through countryside and rural villages, to the Kuang Si Waterfalls where you will be among the first visitors of the day. After a gentle walk of around 10 minutes you will find a private picnic breakfast waiting for you in our favourite spot, overlooking the natural turquoise pools which have formed between the cascading layers of the falls. Every object has been sourced locally, from the hand-woven tablecloth and basketry to the freshly squeezed fruit juice and “Champagne of Coffee”, which is grown in the Boloven Plateau, southern Laos. The menu includes fresh fruit, yoghurt and muesli before smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels and a selection of fresh breads, pastries and organic jam.\n\nHaving taken your time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast you might wish to spend some time walking around the various levels of the waterfall. You are also very welcome to swim the natural pools. Please note that the water will be cold from November – March and if you do swim then please be careful not to show too much flesh (no skimpy bikinis please!).\n\nBefore you leave you might like to visit the bear sanctuary which is next to the falls, run by Free The Bears Fund Inc. There are currently 23 Asiatic Black Bears living in the sanctuary, which has saved them from poaching. The main threat to these bears is poaching due to the use of their bile in Chinese medicine.

Tad Fane is a set of twin 120-meter-high waterfalls formed by the merging waters of the Champy and Pak Koot rivers. These impressive falls are situated on the edge of Dong Hua Sao protected area, 38km from Paksé (Note: water levels may vary accordingly to the previous rainy season).\n\nMake a short stop in Paksong, the small capital of coffee. Then, continue east to reach the Sinouk Coffee Resort. An expert in coffee will guide you through the coffee plantation and you will learn more about how the coffee trees are grown and the difference processing stages.\n\nAfter the visit, enjoy a delicious lunch. Most of the vegetables supplied to the cuisine come from our home-grown organic garden. Following lunch, you will of course have the chance to taste different types of coffee.\n\nOn the drive back to Pakse, two stops will be made.

To provide an all-encompassing insight into Vientiane and its rich history and culture, this half-day guided tour visits the city’s elegant temples, unique monuments and French colonial buildings before ending with a leisurely stroll along the Mekong. \n\nNote: Tour starts in the morning at 0830 or in the afternoon at 1330.\n\nEnjoy a half-day guided tour to discover the hidden charms of Vientiane, whose name means ‘the city of sandal wood’. Vientiane is one of the quietest capital cities in the world, far away from the bustle and hustle of other Asian capitals.\n\nYour tour begins at the serene Wat Sisaket, the only temple left intact after the Siamese (Thai) invasion in 1828. It is one of the most beautiful temples in the capital, and its breezy teak covered hallways are filled with thousands of miniature Buddha statues.\n\nContinue on to the nearby Wat Phra Keo.  Used as a religious museum, Wat Phra Keo displays a collection of both Lao and Khmer works of art. Also nearby, is the Presidential Palace.

After passing through a small entrance hole you descend 100 meters into the ground. However, the cave widens once inside, where a reclining Buddha statue welcomes visitors to a place once serving as the home to bats, gibbons, monkeys, and antelope. Tham Pou Kham displays several wet rock formations including a pair of \"Golden Crabs\". After exploring the cavern, you might like to go for a cold swim in the Ka River's water hole. The water is clean, deep, and safe for jumping in if you feeling brave, before transferring south to your next stop.\n\nConsidered by many as Vang Vieng's most important cave, Tham Chang (or Jang) became the home for migrating people, who settled near the town's southern Meuang Xong Village to raise vegetables. The locals stumbled into the cavern during a civil war, while seeking refuge deep in the forest. Because its high location offered perfect views of Vang Vieng, the entire village moved there to sit out the war, and named their haven 'Tham Jang' (Hang Around Cave). Years later during the colonial era, the locals returned to cultivating the nearby fields and would bathe in the cave's basin, where the water was so cold they said it could freeze your legs to a firm stiffness. They then adjusted the cave's name to 'Tham Chang', which means \"unable to move\", leaving locals no choice but to \"hang around\"! Inside you will find spectacular stalactites and stalagmites and a viewpoint offers an impressive panorama. Once you climb back down you have the option to swim in the natural spring water.\n\nTake a local longtail boat (2 people per boat) to cruise for approximately 1 hour upstream on the Nam Song River, enjoying the beautiful scenery as you go.\n\nArrive at the extensive Organic Farm, which specializes in refreshing mulberry tea as well as having a range of livestock and organic crops. Take a short tour of the Organic Farm and you might choose to stop for lunch here (not included).\n\nIn the early afternoon you will be driven back to your hotel.\n\nYour driver and guide will be staying in Vang Vieng during your time there and will be very happy to explore further with you, or you might prefer to enjoy the remainder of your time here at leisure.","durationSlots":2,"guideLanguage":"French","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/dgv4re2tq1hvnob/18.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CIT","localityName":"Central"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"36613LAO","productOptCode":"VTEPKEXOVTELDVVFG","rank":23,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Nature & Wildlife","Heritage & Culture","Honeymoon","Classic Journeys"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"2588LAO","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"2588LAO","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"FD Peaceful VVG","voucherName":"EXO Travel Vientiane"}}

Then, travel to a nice garden on the Mekong River where you will begin the preparation for lunch. It is a good way to learn more about the Lao culture, traditional cooking, original ingredients and how to make perfect sticky rice!\nYou will receive a Lao recipe booklet so that you can take your experience home.\n\nPRAY: After lunch (around 13:30), you will be transferred outside of the city to Wat Sok Pa Luang. This is still described by many as ‘the forest temple’, although as Vientiane expands it feels like an oasis within the suburbs, rather than being out on a limb. On the way to the temple you will stop with your guide at a local market to buy snacks and fruit to give as offerings to the monks (we suggest avoiding plastic wrappers and spending approximately $2-3 per person, so fruits and local snacks wrapped in banana leaves are ideal). Monks of all ages live and study here and as part of your visit we will have made an appointment for you to sit down with one or two of them for an informal discussion on the subject of Buddhism and the life of a monk, including plenty of time for you to ask questions. Then you will experience a private meditation session. You then have time to explore the grounds with your guide.\n\nLOVE: Complete your experience with a relaxing one hour Lao traditional massage in one of the best spa center in town.\n\nTransfer back to your hotel early this evening.","durationSlots":2,"guideLanguage":"French","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh0mpqivh1eqe5v/10.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CIT","localityName":"Central"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"35850LAO","productOptCode":"VTEPKEXOVTEFDEFSG","rank":10,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Skiing","Heritage & Culture"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"2588LAO","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"2588LAO","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"FD Vientiane Immersion","voucherName":"EXO Travel Vientiane"}}

A private meeting with monks and visits to excellent charities are all great in terms of Responsible Travel, whilst giving perspective on how Laos has come to be as it is today and what the future might hold. \n\nNote: This half day tour starts in the morning at 0830 or in the afternoon at 1330.\n\nFirst you will travel outside of Vientiane with your guide to Wat Sok Pa Luang. This is still described by many as ‘the forest temple’, although as Vientiane expands it feels like an oasis within the suburbs, rather than being out on a limb. On the way to the temple you will stop with your guide at a local market to buy snacks and fruit to give as offerings to the monks (we suggest avoiding plastic wrappers and spending approximately $2-3 per person, so fruits and local snacks wrapped in banana leaves are ideal). Monks of all ages live and study here and as part of your visit we will have made an appointment for you to sit down with one or two of them for an informal discussion on the subject of Buddhism and the life of a monk, including plenty of time for you to ask questions. You then have time to explore the grounds with your guide.\n\nNext you will travel out of the city to Mai Savanh and explore the traditional textiles of the Lao people. This shop specializes in high quality silk products and involves several families in the process, from the northern province of Luang Nam Tha and the southern provinces of Attapeu and Sekong. (Note: Mai Savanh is closed on Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday.)\n\nAnother stop will be made at the Lao Disabled Women Development Centre. This center aims to bring knowledge and skills to disabled women so that they can become self-sufficient, productive members of the community. Efforts are focused on helping people with disabilities gain independence and self-confidence. A visit to the center provides you with the opportunity to talk to these women and to observe their skill at creating handicrafts such as hand-made paper. (Note: Lao Disabled Women Development Centre is fully operational Monday – Friday. On Saturdays and Sundays we can visit the showroom by appointment)\n\nReturn to the city and visit COPE, an association working to help landmine victims. A visit to the center provides in-depth information about the history of the American/Vietnam war and the lasting impact of unexploded ordinances (UXO) in the area and the efforts underway to clear them.\n\nReturn to your hotel.\n\nTime: 0830 – 1330 \nDeparture: Daily \n\nOur services include: \n- Transport in an air-conditioned vehicle \n- 1 English Speaking Guide \n- All entrance fees \n- All permissions and local taxes\n- Drinking water and cold towel\n\nOur services do not include: \n- Meals and drinks (other than water)\n- Personal expenses\n- Personal travel insurance \n- Visa\n- Tips (optional) \n- Other services not clearly indicated in the Package Inclusion above","durationSlots":1,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/h3gf2nc92h6k7qd/23.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CIT","localityName":"Central"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"35569LAO","productOptCode":"VTEPKEXOVTEMCVTEG","rank":34,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Family with teenagers","Art & Architecture"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"2588LAO","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"2588LAO","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"HD Monks and Charities of Vientiane","voucherName":"EXO Travel Vientiane"}}

The purpose of the Baci, which is a mix of Animist and Buddhist beliefs, is to call back escaped spirits to the body.

This day trip will allow you to visit villages that maintain Kraton traditions of Batik, the creation of the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Puppet) and a bicycle tour of the former capital of the Mataram Kingdom – Kotagede. Gain an insight into the rebuilding of villages that were devastated in the 2006 Volcanic eruptions.\n\nAfter an early breakfast, depart your Hotel for a 30 min drive to the northern gates of the charming village of Kotagede which retains some of Central Java’s best examples of traditional Javanese architecture; and is known as the Silver Village due to the concentration of artisans. \n\nOn arrival to the village you will take a short bicycle ride through the laneways to a master baker’s house so you can sample Kembang Waru – a type of cookie only sold in Kotagede and made in rudimentary conditions . Continue by bicycle to the central traditional market where you will take a tour of this bustling location once the main market in the area. Resume your leisurely cycling, arriving at the oldest mosque in Jogjakarta (1575) where you don Javanese dress, a sign of respect for the former kings and then on to the Royal Cemetery of the First King of the Mataram Kingdom. Take a walking tour of the linking laneways to discover the ‘Kalang’ style architecture which is indigenous to Kota Gede – a combination of Javanese and Colonial styles. Enjoy lunch at a local joglo style house before cycling to your starting point, returning to your vehicle and travelling to the village of Pucung where they use a particular technique for making and painting on buffalo hides to make the shadow puppet or Wayang Kulit. These techniques have been passed down from generation to generation – often from a very early age – also a great insight into rural village life. Continue to the artisan Batik Village of Giriloyo where this UNESCO listed tradition dates back over a century where you will enjoy a demonstration of Batik methods and learn more about the motifs of the area. UNESCO listed as original heritage in Indonesia, the Keris, or dagger, stems from before the 8th century as relief sculptures of the Keris can be seen on Borobudur temple as part of the meditation practice. The village of Banyusumurup creates the Sheath for the Keris - intricately designed and loaded with symbolism – take tea with one of the best regarded Keris makers in Java and learn about the techniques and mysteries of the Keris. \n\nFinally return to Jogjakarta via Kasongan village. Situated in a low mountainous area, Kasongan is home to a group of kundis, the local word for potters who make earthenware jugs. You’ll see the ceramic-making process from kneading to shaping, drying and burning. A great place for local artisan purchases. Return to your hotel late afternoon.

During the tour, you will take a comprehensive and interactive journey through the livelihood of the local Inthar people of Inle Lake. You will dress in traditional Inthar clothing, join local fisherman to try and catch your daily protein, and ride along floating gardens, picking fresh vegetables. You will be specially invited into an Inthar home to help prepare and cook a traditional meal.\n\nYour guide will greet you at your hotel this morning to embark on your Inle Lake day trip. Your guide will have a pair of Intha trousers and hat to prepare for your morning ‘as a local.’ Board your private motorboat (on board are cushioned wooden chairs, lifejackets, umbrellas- for sun and wind protection, and blankets in the winter months)\n\nAlong the way, your boat will stop to observe one of the local Inthar fishermen. The local technique is to use one leg to balance the boat, the other leg to support the fishing cage, one arm to aim the fishing cage, and the other arm to steer. It is a skill and a practice that is unique to the region that must be witnessed. This technique takes years to master so your tour guide will provide fishing poles to catch lunch the ‘easy’ way. There are over 20 different species of fish in Inle but the main catch is typically carp and catfish. If your morning fishing is unsuccessful, there is always an opportunity to buy fish at the market.\n\nAnother unique practice used on Inle Lake that is used by locals are the floating gardens. Local farmers create beds from weeds and weave them to bamboo poles that dig into the lake’s floor. On top of the bed, tomatoes, eggplant, and other produce is ‘planted’ on top, using the water and the lakes nutrients to speed up growth. Your trip will take you through these gardens where you will have the opportunity to select the produce for your lunch. (Which vegetables depends on seasonality).\n\nReach the local Inthar home, located adjacent to Inle’s silk weaving factory, where you will meet your family host. In the traditional Inthar kitchen you will begin your interactive cooking class. You will learn to cook local favorites like stuffed carp/catfish (depending on catch) steamed in banana leaf, Inthar tomato salad, fried tofu cakes, stuffed potato rice balls, and many others.\n\nReturn to your hotel by midday.\n\nTime:   08.30 – 13.00 (L)\n\nOur services include:\n- English-speaking local guide\n- Private boat\n- Intha trousers and hat\n- Water and refreshing towel\n\nOur services do not include:\n- Meals other than mentioned\n- Drinks and personal expenses\n- Any other items not mentioned\n- Inle Lake Zone Fee","durationSlots":1,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/f0sk4ypdm9h8z4l/28.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"OLK","localityName":"Lake Area"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"23537MYN","productOptCode":"INLPKEXSHPKMHINIL","rank":9,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Wellness & Spirit","Active","Promotion & Green Season","Sustainable","Culinary"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"1188MYN","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"1188MYN","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"HD The Inthar Life","voucherName":"Exo Shan State Package"}}

Depending on the exhibitions on show at the time you visit, and the photographs on display on the second floor, you should be able to get a grasp of how the city has evolved over time and get a look into its captivating history. From here you will head to one of the most famous and prestigious museums in the country, and in Asia: The Shanghai Museum. \n\nThe collection of bronze statues on the first floor is unrivalled, and is complemented by a number of jade pieces of artwork, as well as Qing Dynasty furniture, Buddhist sculptures and other pieces of Chinese artwork.

Travel to Kyauk Se to see the incredible Shinpin Tamoke Shwegu, an 11th century temple of historical importance that was only recently excavated then continue to Paleik where you’ll walk through Ava-era temples shrouded in vines and tucked amid local villages. For architecture and archaeology lovers, this is the perfect day off the beaten track.\n\nYour guide and driver will greet you at your hotel this morning to set off on your excursion to the outskirts of Mandalay. We begin with a drive to Kyauk Se, a town south of Mandalay (around 1-1.5 hours). The town is most famous for its annual Elephant-dance festival but in 2009 the Shinpin Tamoke Shwegu site was discovered.\n\nOne of 9 temples built by King Anawratha, the 11th century site was covered in a new wall in the 13th century then abandoned. Over the years, layers of dirt and growth have covered the temple and only recently was the temple discovered. More than 8000 volunteers helped to excavate the site in 2009. When visiting you will see incredible, intricate stucco carvings untouched by time- the only place besides Bagan to see such decoration. There is also an unusual nested Buddha statue and a small museum of artifacts on site.\n\nNearby is Shinpin Sut-thwar temple where we will stop for a brief visit to see its Buddha images, another unique design.\n\nA stop will be made in Kyauk Se for lunch and an option to visit the local market if you wish.\n\nContinue back toward Mandalay stopping in the town of Paleik. Most travelers visit Paleik to see its famous snake temple but the real lure is its more than 300 temples. Built during the same period as Ava (14th century) the temples are abandoned, covered in ivy and connected by dirt paths. We’ll spend time walking amid the ruins, enjoying the blend of nature and man-made buildings as well as learning about the history of the area. There is a small village and two monasteries in the vicinity which we will walk through for a taste of local life.\n\nAfter your exploration, return to Mandalay and your hotel. \n\nTime:   08.30 – 17.30 \n\nOur services include:\n- English-speaking guide\n- Transfers with private air-conditioned vehicle with driver\n- Lunch at a local restaurant\n- Water and refreshing towel\n\nOur services do not include:\n- Meals other than mentioned\n- Drinks and personal expenses\n- Any other items not mentioned\n- Mandalay Zone Fee","durationSlots":2,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3l4ehkxq68k0rhq/2.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"OSC","localityName":"Outside City"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"22862MYN","productOptCode":"MDLPKEXMDPKMDMAKS","rank":66,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Multi-activity"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"1186MYN","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"1186MYN","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"FD Kyauk Se &amp; Paleik Architecture Discovery","voucherName":"Exo Mandalay Package"}}

Vegetable sellers are seen trading their fresh produce plucked from the fields that morning, fish traders with their live catch and (thanks to the legacy of the French) frogs and the endless stalls of cuisine: rice noodle soup, grilled meats served on a bed of fresh herbs as well as sweet cakes and sticky rice puddings. \n\nFrom the market drive to a temple along the river banks which worships Saint Chu Dong Tu and his wife Princess Tien Dung, who has been honoured as one of four immortal Vietnamese spirits. The temple is set on large peaceful grounds consisting of several large gates; pass through the yard into the main altar house where incense can be seen burning as it has for hundreds of years. The temple also houses rare wood engravings on its roof as well as two bach tho vases which have ancient non characters (the ancient script of Vietnam before it became romanized) engraved in various styles on them. \n\nFrom the temple drive back to the village then take a stroll through Van Giang to the 150-year old home of Mr An who at 65-years old has one of the most impressive Bonsai collections in the district.

On each side of the entrance path a row of 54 gods or demons is holding the sacred Naga snake.\n\nFrom here, continue to Bayon Temple in the exact center of the city. This 12th century masterpiece is a study in grandeur and is well-known for its 54 towers with enigmatic faces representing the 54 provinces of the Great Khmer Empire.

Built during the reign of King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century, Angkor Wat is constructed following the model of the temple mountain symbolizing Mount Meru, the home of the gods. Inside the temple, the walls are covered with stone carvings and bas-reliefs depicting Hindu mythology and the wars Suryavarman II fought during his reign.

Every morning at 4.30 the monks and locals gather at Mahamuni to wash the statue’s face with scented water and clean his teeth with a soft brush. This bizarre yet beautiful ceremony is worth getting out of bed for!\n\nNext we continue to a local neighborhood to witness the daily alms collection of the monks. Clothed in red robes and carrying their alms bowls, a solemn line of barefoot monks walks along the streets to collect offerings from the locals. The morning alms collection is an important part of daily life for the monks and for the Burmese people as it symbolizes ‘making merit’ and also reminds to Buddhist of their mutual inter-dependence.\n\nAfter these beautiful ceremonies it’s time to head to the morning market in central Mandalay. Covering several city blocks the market is a hive of activity in the early morning hours with vendors selling mounds of fresh produce, meats, flowers and other items and shoppers arriving by trishaw or motorbike. You may even see monks and nuns walking through the market to collect alms or purchase items for the monastery. The setting is incredibly colourful and as you walk through the market you are likely to see things you have never seen before- from exotic fruits and spices to dried meats and prepared sweets.\n\nFinally it’s time for breakfast! We’ll visit a local tea shop- a busy meeting place throughout the day and an integral part of Burmese life. Sip a hot cup of coffee or try the local tea, a strong brew mixed with sweetened condensed milk. You’ll sample a bowl of local noodles- Mandalay is famous for its mee shay (noodles with pork or chicken, bean sprouts, toasted chickpea flour, rice flour gel, soy sauce and various herbs) and nan gyi thoke or mont di (rice noodle with a chicken curry- the difference is the size of the noodles). You can also have mohinga or Shan noodles if you wish other dishes such as curries, rice and chappati are also available.\n\nThen transfer back to your hotel to freshen up before the day’s other sightseeing.\n\nTime:   04.00 – 08.30 / 09.00\n\nOur services include:\n- English-speaking guide\n- Private air-conditioned car with driver\n- Entrance fees for Mahamuni Pagoda\n- Breakfast with tea/coffee\n- Water and refreshing towel\n\nOur services do not include:\n- Meals other than mentioned\n- Drinks and personal expenses\n- Any other items not mentioned","durationSlots":1,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wxj1qc8orrdspzz/9.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CTY","localityName":"City Area"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"22876MYN","productOptCode":"MDLPKEXMDPKMHMAMM","rank":9,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Trekking","Sustainable","Skiing"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"1186MYN","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"1186MYN","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"HD Morning in Mandalay","voucherName":"Exo Mandalay Package"}}

The hustle and bustle fades away as you enter the peace and serenity of southern Inle. In the south, the water is crystal clear and reflects the Shan mountain backdrop.\n\nSurrounding Inle Lake are multiple hill tribes – Pa Oh, Inthar, Palong - to name a few. All the different tribes mix with one another during market day. To give all farmers an opportunity to sell their produce, the market rotates every 5 days to a different part of Inle. If it is market day in Nampan, take a quick visit to the market and observe the eclectic mix of hill tribes as they buy and trade goods.\n\nAt Nampan village, you will visit a local cigar manufacturer, also known as cheroot. Watch as they hand roll every single cigar to be sold nationwide. At the cheroot factory your guide and boatman will unload the kayaks and where your journey through southern Inle Lake begins.\n\nYou’ll start by paddling through the small fishing village of Nampan as you float through tiny canals and tributaries. Many of the locals in the back channels aren’t yet accustomed to seeing foreigners, let alone neon-colored modern kayaks, so remember to be kind with a smile and a wave as you drift along.\n\nYou will exit the canals of Nampan and reenter the main part of Inle Lake toward the village of Mine Pyo. Paddle alongside the traditional one-leg rowing fisherman and marvel at their balance and focus. While balancing on one foot, the fisherman wraps an oar around his other foot to steer while casting a net with his free hands. This traditional fishing technique has been taught and practiced through generations and requires years of practice to master.\n\nAt Mine Pyo, you will stop at a local Inthar house for traditional Shan tea and some local snacks. Enjoy local soy products like crackers and fried tofu as well as locally made Shan ‘doughnuts.’ Take a moment to take in the view before finishing the final leg and paddling to Se Sone village.\n\nFinish up the day at another local Inthar home in Se Sone village.

By boat, car and jeep visit four auspicious sites and travel amid rural villages bringing the legend to reality while getting a chance to see Burmese local life.\n\nDiscover one of Bagan’s most famous legends as you follow in the tracks of King Anawrahta and his precious white elephant. The tale states that the King was given a replica of Lord Buddha’s tooth and he placed this on the sacred elephant’s back and set him free. The elephant stopped at four places around Bagan and later the King built stupas at each of these locations. Thus the local Burmese believe that by visiting all four of these places in one day your wish will be fulfilled.\n\nYour Legendary Tour begins in the morning, with your guide and driver greeting you at the hotel. A stop will first be made at Nyaung U market, a colorful local market that is busy in the morning with vendors selling a range of products. Then visit Shwezigon Pagoda. Although this is one of Bagan’s most famous sites, few people realize the legend behind its creation. The centre piece of Shwezigon is its large golden bell-shaped pagoda situated upon three terraces. The lower-most terrace once featured wood carvings of nat spirits but these are now housed in a small hall within the temple grounds.\n\nContinue on to Tu Yin Taung, a hilltop stupa in the eastern part of the main Archeological Park. As you approach the temple you will be greeted by 500 monk statues which line the road. The stupa’s elevated location offers fabulous views of the surrounding plains, a unique perspective of Bagan and its surroundings.\n\nThe next stop is Lawka Nandar which is in New Bagan next to the Irrawaddy River. Lawka Nandar is a bulbous stupa with a cylindrical bell and three octagonal terraces as a base. The temple still functions as a place of everyday worship as it is home to a Buddha relic. We’ll make a stop at Nanduwan Restaurant for lunch before continuing on our Legendary Tour.\n\nThis afternoon we drive to the jetty where a private boat is waiting to transfer us across the river to Tant Kyi Taung, the last temple on our tour. From the boat, as you cruise across the Irrawaddy, you can see views of the temples in the distance. We travel by jeep (approximately 15 minutes) through the countryside to Tant Kyi Taung. This temple is unique in Bagan as it is thought that many centuries ago, Buddha stopped on the hill where the temple now stands. On the return drive to the jetty we can stop in Tant Kyi village for a short walk around.\n\nThen it is time to return to Bagan, first crossing the river by boat and then continuing to your hotel by car.

Midday, take a break from island exploring and we make a short boat ride to the nearby Gili Sudak where we have a lunch of grilled fish in a very simple warung on the beach, a few meters away from the gently rippling sea.

Begin your tour at Cambodia’s Royal Palace, which stands majestically in the city centre just off the riverfront area. Several buildings are open to visitors including the ‘Silver Pagoda’ whose floor is lined with solid silver tiles. Continue to the National Museum. Located in a fabulous old building, the Museum is filled with art and artifacts dating back to the pre-Angkorian era.  At the north end of the city is the hilltop pagoda of Wat Phnom, for which the capital was named. Climb the stairs to the top of the hill for fabulous views of the city below.\nIn the afternoon take a look into the country’s tragic recent history with a tour of Tuol Sleng Prison (S-21) and the Killing Fields at Choeung Ek, sobering reminders of the evils of the Khmer Rouge regime. Although not a joyful tour, visiting these monuments unlocks keys to understanding the development of this still developing country. In between there is also time for a visit to the ‘Russian Market’.

Arriving at 7.00 am into Jogja (as it is known by the locals) gives a full day to explore. Visit the Hindu temples of Prambanan, the Sultan’s Palace and the magnificent Borobudur before returning to Bali late evening.\n\nTake an early breakfast for your flight to Yogyakarta GA251 departing at 0650 and arriving in Jogjakarta at 0710. (NB: No Guide will accompany on flight. Flight ticket is not included and quoted separately) Yogyakarta is the most popular tourist destination on Java, largely thanks to its proximity to the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. Jogjakarta is a center of art and education and the cradle of traditional Javanese culture. \n\nUpon arrival in Yogyakarta airport, our guide and private car will meet you and transfer you to visit the Sultan’s Palace, also known as Kraton - the central aspect of the Javanese cosmology with the Kraton being at the centre of the Mt Merapi and Parangtritis Beach lines. This building constructed between 1756 –1790, is a fine example of traditional Javanese sultanate architecture. Remaining today as the residence of the Sultan, this living museum features a showcase of Javanese Culture and relics and depending on your day of visiting there will be a cultural performance ranging from Golek Menak Puppet‘s to classical Javanese Poetry performance known as Macapat. Travelling by becak (similar to a trishaw) you’ll visit the adjacent ‘Taman Sari’, water palace and garden. This addition to the royal complex was built over 200 years ago by the first Sultan with bathing pools for his harem. Next, travel to the ancient Hindu temples at Prambanan, located 17 kilometres from Yogyakarta (around 50min). Built in the 9th century, this collection of sharp, jagged temples features three main inner shrines dedicated to the Hindu trinity: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. UNESCO named Prambanan a Heritage Site in 1991. Your guide will explain the history and symbolism of the temples as you walk around. \n\nEnjoy lunch in a local restaurant before driving to Borobudur, 42 kilometers west of Yogyakarta (around 1.5hrs). With your guide, explore this massive Buddhist Temple- the largest in the world- and discover the incredible history behind its construction. Comprised of thousands of volcanic and river stone blocks, the temple was assembled entirely by human labor and took more than 75 years to complete. These days, the UNESCO Heritage site is still visible in its full glory- with magnificent carvings and an unusual, yet surprisingly beautiful bulk structure. Nearby Pawon and Mendut temples are older than Borobudur, with Mendut - a pyramid-shaped temple which houses three impressively carved stone statues; and Pawon temple, a simple yet beautiful monument known for its precise symmetry. If there’s time take a stroll through the surrounding rice fields before visiting the craftsman of Nglipoh village throwing traditional pottery in all shapes and sizes, used in households all over Java. During this tour you will experience firsthand how the local Javanese people live and interact with their local environment and witness age old skills, famous in this part of Indonesia. Transfer to Yogyakarta airport at the end of the day in time for your return flight to Bali. Garuda Airlines flight GA254, depart at 2030 and arrive at 2250.

Nowadays the water puppet show is a great way to understand traditional Vietnamese folklore as the puppets dance out vignettes, or small stories, of daily life. Meet Mr. Liem, a water puppet craftsman who is a seventh generation puppet master. His father devoted his entire life to this art and created “Chu Teu”, the water puppet symbol currently exhibited in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Mr. Liem, who has more than 20 years experience in the art of puppet making, has created a new puppet model that allows one person to control many puppets at the same time. Spend half day learning about this traditional form of story telling and discover how the puppets are made from a true artisan. \nApproximate length of the tour (including 2 ways transfer): 2 hours \n\nTake a short drive to Mr. Liem’s house, where he will warmly greet you. Here you will have the chance to explore his workshop. The shelves are lined with wooden puppet parts such as angel wings, buffalo tails and puppets of all shapes and sizes. He has built a smaller scale water puppet theater where you can watch a 30 minute performance telling both Ancient and modern stories of traditions and daily life. After the show, it is your turn to roll up your sleeves and try to make the dragon puppet chase its tail and spit water. Finally, enjoy a 30 minute experience of puppet painting.

The temple is not yet restored but has spectacular carvings and lintels which are almost as splendid as those at Banteay Srei. The temple is known to have been dedicated to the god Shiva and thought to have been constructed in the reign of Suryavarman I (1002-50), with further significant additions by Suryavarman II (1113-50).

This city is surrounded by an 8 m high wall, drawing a perfect square. Enter the city through the ancient South Gate, an impressive stone gate carved with Elephants and four giant faces. On each side of the entrance path a row of 54 gods or demons is holding the sacred Naga snake.\n\nFrom here, continue to Bayon Temple in the exact center of the city. This 12th century masterpiece is a study in grandeur and is well-known for its 54 towers with enigmatic faces representing the 54 provinces of the Great Khmer Empire. The Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper King are also must-visits as they are both known for their intricate bas-reliefs.\n\nTake a break for lunch (at own expense), before you continue to Ta Prohm. Ta Prohm is unique in that it has been left largely as it was found: overgrown by jungle trees and vines, with many parts of the temple crumbling to the ground. This makes the ‘Tomb Raider Temple’ one of the most picturesque and memorable of the Angkor temples.\n\nNow you are ready for the highlight: The magnificent Angkor Wat. Built during the reign of King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century, Angkor Wat is constructed following the model of the temple mountain symbolizing Mount Meru, the home of the gods. Inside the temple, the walls are covered with stone carvings and bas-reliefs depicting Hindu mythology and the wars Suryavarman II fought during his reign. Angkor Wat is well known for the more than 2,000 Apsara dancers decorating the temple. Construction is thought to have taken around thirty years of intensive labor. Today, Angkor Wat is figured on Cambodia's national flag as the temple symbolizes the soul of the Khmer people.\n\nYou will be there during sunset time, when Angkor Wat is less visited and the Apsaras will shine in the most beautiful light.

It was here that Jayavarman II declared himself a ‘god-king’ and gave birth to the Khmer Empire in AD 802.\n\nArrive at the Kulen Mountain near the Preah Ang Thom pagoda. Meet your motodup (motorbike) driver who will take you for the next few hours around the mountain. You will ride as a passenger along bumpy or slippery country roads and tracks, over volcanic rocks and occasionally through shallow streams. \n\nThe first stop is at Poeng Tbal where a river bed reveals a well preserved stone with details of Shiva and Vishnu and the rocks carvings of Ganesh and wise men.\n\nA short ride on leads to one of the most important sites in all of Cambodia: a small pedestal that is set on top of three tiered pyramid temple called Prasat Rong Chen. Whilst there is little to see today the significance is huge: it is at this point that Jayavarman II declared himself the absolute monarch of the Cambodian Kingdom and announced independence from Java. The linga has been stolen from the pedestal but as you stand here take a few moments to contemplate that the Khmer Empire began at this very spot. Whilst the sites on the mountain have been known for many years to the Khmer people and those living on the mountain, it has only recently confirmed that Phnom Kulen was the location of Mahendraparvata. It was only discovered in mid-2012 as a result of Australian archaeologists using laser mapping equipment flying overhead. Mahendraparvata served as a huge service city for Angkor, a completely unrivalled urban landscape in the pre-industrial world. \n \nHead across more paths to a modern temple with colorful statues and a scenic view. Enjoy a simple, packed lunch at the temple dining room.\n\nContinue after a short break to a Bat Cave which with the help of torches you can enter for a few hundred meters and see a modern shrine. Both the cave and the temple attract many pilgrims to the area.\n\nA short distance on is Srah Damrei (or Elephant Pond). The life size stone elephant served as a guardian for the mountain. The smaller statues of lions, a cow and a frog will also impress. \n\nHead on to back to the starting point with some more stone carvings to be seen at  Damrei Khrap (Kneeling Elephant). The motodup adventure then finishes at Preah Ang Thom.\nTwo more stops are made before your return – the first one is a short visit to see the River of a Thousand Lingas – hundreds of the linga carvings can be seen on a stretch of the river. After visit Kulen Waterfall where you can take a refreshing bath.      \n\nIt is then time to drive back to Siem Reap and to your hotel.

From the fresh white spaces of leading contemporary art galleries to the grand halls of the HCMC Fine Arts museum, the journey takes participants from colonialism to independence, communism to globalization. The tour is based on the personal experiences of artists who studied, fought, witnessed and documented major changes in twentieth century Vietnam. It is perfect for art lovers and those who want to gain a deeper understanding of Vietnam’s history. Led by art historian and Saigon resident, Sophie Hughes, this journey through time is inspiring, educational, and fun. \n\nDepart at 09.00 from your hotel to a café to enjoy traditional Vietnamese sweet coffee and have an overview of the tour. View a private collection of works housed in a traditional Saigon villa by students who studied at the first French founded School of Fine Arts. Innovative use of visual aids compares the striking similarities between Vietnamese students of the 1920’s to their contemporaries in Paris. Drive to a private home converted into a gallery to see a remarkable collection of Vietnamese Combat Art and Propaganda Art. The gallery owner has been carrying out primary research on combat artists for years collecting paintings that illustrate the incredible war time hardship artists endured to produce works during this time. Continue to the impressive HCMC Fine Arts Museum, a stunning example of Sino-French architecture, to learn how artists have been tools of the government during resistance, revolution and reconstruction of a nation. The artworks from Northern and Southern artists before and after re-unification demonstrate how politics lead to Vietnam’s 90’s art market boom. \n\nThe last stop is a contemporary art gallery which works with Vietnamese and international artists nurturing experimentation and creating opportunities for emerging artists. Meet with the Director and talk about the current exhibition. \n\nEnd the tour with a final discussion about the future of Vietnamese art in an international context and what that means for the next generation of Vietnamese artists. \n\nTime: \t09.00 – 13.00 \nDeparture:\t Daily \nNotes: \tThis tour is only operated in the morning until 13.00.

The journey covers more than 25kms through the quaint countryside of Southern Vietnam. \n\nDeparture from Ho Chi Minh City at 0800 and transfer by vehicle 30km out of Saigon to avoid the teeming traffic. Cycle backroads to the Cu Chi Tunnels. Spend the morning riding backroads to Cu Chi tunnels, which were more than 250 km long and three levels deep, were important for the Viet Cong victory over the Americans as they allowed the Viet Cong to control a large rural area around Sai Gon. Along the way pass rice fields, rubber plantations and local villages. \n\nToday the remaining tunnels have become a major tourist attraction giving the visitor a unique experience of what underground life in the American war was like. The district of Cu Chi was the most bombed shelled, gassed, defoliated, and generally devastated area in the history of warfare. While U.S. forces relied on artillery support from fixed \"Fire Bases,\" the Vietnamese used their tunnel system to move their artillery around, making it difficult for the U.S. troops to locate them. \n\nLunch at the tunnels next to the Saigon River.

In an open-air, fully renovated, American war-era jeep set off from Hoi An toward the ruins of My Son, home to the grand Champa Kingdom who built dozens of red brick towers during the 7th – 13th centuries. Thanks to 4 wheel-drive, the jeep is able to leave the main road behind and follow quiet rural laneways out of Hoi An and into the heart of the Vietnam countryside. Pass through farms, villages and ‘middle of nowhere’ places all the while enjoying the fresh air and spectacular views that only come from traveling in a Jeep. \nRaise a few eyebrows from curious locals and stop as often as you like for photos. Reach My Son in the late morning hours; stop to have lunch in a local restaurant before setting off on foot to the ruins of My Son. Venture around the paths, visiting the numerous ruins and soaking in the atmosphere of this historic site. Mid afternoon begin the drive back to Hoi An along different backroads that run parallel to the Thu Bon River.

Hanoi Old Quarter is a unique destination for its eclectic array of traditional local daily life, and is equally vibrant by both day or by night.  Life is lived on the streets here and throughout Hanoi’s ‘Old Quarter’, from the markets to food stalls to coffee shops, food is everywhere.\n\nWalking through the small lanes, winding backstreets and hidden alleys where a multitude of vendors set up their stalls and stools along the route, your guide will point out some places of interest. At one of the inner city’s most popular local eateries there is the chance to sample what probably could be termed Vietnam’s ‘national dish’ – the world renowned “pho”! The most popular choices are “pho bo” (beef noodle soup) or “Pho ga” (chicken noodle soup). Continue exploring the lively small streets stopping to sample some of Hanoi’s other favorite Street food including “Banh Cuon”, “Bun Cha” and “Nem Chua Ran” at various spots along the way. Depending on the season other local street snacks and seasonal streetfood will also be sampled, and a stop will be made at one of the local outdoor BBQ stalls which are popular with the locals. Take a break whilst enjoying a typical Hanoian dessert – either “che” (sweet soup) or “hoa qua dam” (fresh fruit with yoghurt).\n\nFinish the evening in the same manner the Hanoi locals do – enjoying a local “bia hoi” (draft beer) sitting by the street watching the ever changing night street scenes, before returning to your hotel. \n\n\nNotes: \tTour is on a private basis.

Visit three stupas where many years ago sacred Buddha relics, brought from India, were enshrined by two merchant brothers. Join local pilgrims on this fascinating spiritual journey.\n\nYour guide and driver will greet you at your hotel to embark on your Pilgrimage Tour. Legend states that 2000 years ago two merchant brothers traveled from Yangon to India with 8 holy hairs from Gottama Buddha. Along the way several were stolen yet the King in Yangon placed the remaining 4 relics in a special box and they miraculously replicated to the original number. This auspicious occasion was followed by the enshrinement of the hairs.\n\nFirst you’ll visit Botataung Pagoda. The 40-metre high golden pagoda is an impressive site from the outside and inside there is a mini museum displaying many interesting items including the sacred relic of legend. This is the site where the brothers arrived back in Yangon, greeted by the king and his soldiers. Botataung means ‘1000 soldiers’ and was built by one of the brothers specifically to house this relic.\n\nDrive toward central downtown, where you can drive or take a short walking tour past the colonial-style buildings such as the Post Office and Strand Hotel, to Mahabandoola Park and Sule Paya. \n\nSule Paya is located in the centre of downtown and is an octagonal Mon-style pagoda. Throughout the day Sule Paya is busy with local pilgrims and monks who come to pray and pay their respects to the Buddha relic, placed here by descendants of the second brother.\n\nFinally you’ll visit Shwedagon Pagoda, where the remaining relics were enshrined. This 99-metre high golden temple is one of Myanmar’s most iconic sites. Visit around the temple, which is also likely to be busy with local pilgrims, and learn about the myths and beliefs surrounding this pagoda.

Vientiane is one of the quietest capital cities in the world, far away from the hustle and bustle of other Asian capitals. \n\nYour guide will pick you up at 0900 this morning. Your tour begins at the serene WatSisaket, the only temple left intact after the Siamese (Thai) invasion in 1828. It is one of the most beautiful temples in the capital, and its breezy teak covered hallways are filled with thousands of miniature Buddha statues. \n\nContinue on to the nearby WatPhraKeo. Used as a religious museum, WatPhraKeo displays a collection of both Lao and Khmer works of art. Also nearby, is the Presidential Palace. Although you are not allowed to visit inside, it is a good glimpse in to the town’s colonial past as this building formerly served as the French governor’s palace. \n\nStop at WatSimuang, the most popular and venerated temple in Vientiane, as it is considered the guardian of the spirit of the city. Upon its grounds, you will find an Angkorian-era pillar and it is a popular belief that if you circle it three times and make a wish, then that wish will come true. \n\nNestled near the original morning market is That Dam.

From here, travel on to nearby Pangkham Street, with its plethora of tailor shops, and Nam Phou Fountain.

The Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and officially designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, covering an area of around 250,000 hectares in the dry season. Due to a unique phenomenon, when the monsoon begins, the swollen waters of the Mekong River force the Tonle Sap River to reverse its flow northwards, feeding the Great Lake and spreading over the surrounding flood plain.\n\nBoard a local boat and visit the village of Kompong Khleang, where only few tourists venture. Embark on a boat ride through the village where the fisherman and their families live in stilted houses among the petrified mangrove forests and waterways. Enjoy the fascinating scenery of Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake. (Note: during the months Apr-Sep the water level may be too low for a visit by boat. However the village is still fascinating and can be visited by car. Quite dramatic to see how the stilted houses are exposed from lake when water levels are low!)\n\nEnjoy a packed lunch at one of the local houses as you watch everyday life at the village.\n\nAfter lunch head to the quiet Beng Mealea, around 65 km from Siem Reap.

Tour the downtown streets where faded colonial buildings stand alongside the bustling Chinatown and glittering pagodas. Visit iconic sites, fabulous markets and sip tea with the locals- experiencing the best of the city and its many facets.\n\nYour guide and driver will pick you up at your hotel and you’ll venture downtown to explore the city centre and its fabulous mix of architecture and sites. The streets are filled with historical buildings many of which have a faded colonial charm not seen elsewhere in Asia. You’ll start at the post office – a lovely historic building- and walk to Sule Paya in the middle of downtown, passing by Strand Hotel, Mahabandoola Garden and Independence Monument along the way. Then visit Little India and Chinatown, a colorful cacophony of restaurants, temples and markets. Reach Bogyoke Market, formerly known as Scott’s Market, where there is time to browse through the dozens of stalls and shops. This is Yangon’s best market for handicrafts and other goods. (Note: Market is closed on Mondays and public holidays). \n\nLunch at a local restaurant where delicious Burmese cuisine is served in a clean, comfortable environment.\n\nAfter lunch we’ll visit Kyaukhtatgyi Pagoda, home to a 70-meter long reclining Buddha. A visit to Kyaukhtatgyi provides a great overview of Buddhism with murals depicting the life of Buddha, the feet of the statue carved with traditional symbols and often many locals gathering to pay homage and pray. \n\nContinue to a local tea shop for a chance to experience an integral part of Burmese life: drinking tea! Select from an array of snacks and enjoy a coffee or tea as you sit amid businessmen, friends and families who gather at the tea shop to socialize or conduct business. \n\nNext your guided tour goes to Kandawagyi Park, one of central Yangon’s greenest spots. Here you will see the glittering Karaweik barge, a replica of the royal barge, and the vast lake with views of Shwedagon in the background. Depending on the day of your visit Kandawgyi may be busy with local families who come here on the weekend to relax in the fresh air.\n\nFrom here, continue to Shwedagon Pagoda the most revered Buddhist temple in Myanmar. Although the origins of the pagoda are unclear, the local legend states that the original structure was built 2500 years ago then renovated several times until taking its current shape in the 15th century. The 8-sided central stupa is 99 meters tall and gilded with gold leaf and is surrounded by 64 smaller stupas and your guide will show you around the massive complex, explaining why this temple is so revered.

Legend states that 2000 years ago two merchant brothers traveled from Yangon to India with 8 holy hairs from Gottama Buddha.

You will be given a recipe book and apron which you can take home to practice your newly learnt cooking skills and relive your time in Laos!\n\nAfter a few hours of concentration and smelling all of the wonderful flavours, you are sure to enjoy tucking in to your creations for a memorable lunch by the waterfall (one glass of wine/beer/soft drink is included).\n\nYou might wish to enjoy a refreshing swim (if so then please dress modestly). We also suggest a quick visit to the bear sanctuary which is next to the falls, run by Free The Bears Fund Inc.

To provide a comprehensive experience of Vientiane, this full day tour visits the city’s historic temples and national monuments as well as the quirky Buddha Park and local handicraft centers on the outskirts. As the sun sets, end the day with a leisurely stroll along the Mekong\n\nToday enjoy a guided tour to discover the hidden charms of Vientiane, whose name means ‘the city of sandal wood’. Vientiane is one of the quietest capital cities in the world, far away from the bustle and hustle of other Asian capitals.\n\nYour tour begins at the serene Wat Sisaket, the only temple left intact after the Siamese (Thai) invasion in 1828. It is one of the most beautiful temples in the capital, and its breezy teak covered hallways are filled with thousands of miniature Buddha statues.\n\nContinue on to the nearby Wat Phra Keo. Used as a religious museum, Wat Phra Keo displays a collection of both Lao and Khmer works of art. Also nearby, is the Presidential Palace. Although you are not allowed to visit inside, it is a good glimpse in to the town’s colonial past as this building formerly served as the French governor’s palace.\n\nVisit COPE, an association working to help landmine victims. A visit to the center provides in-depth information about the history of the American/Vietnam war and the lasting impact of unexploded ordinances (UXO) in the area and the efforts underway to clear them.\n\nContinue to the Patuxay monument, Laos’ version of the Arc de Triomphe, where you can climb the stairs to the roof for sweeping panoramic views of the city.\n\nNext, your tour takes you to That Luang, the holiest site in Laos. Constructed by King Setthethirat in the 16th century, the temple is resplendent as the sun is shines upon its towering golden spire.\n\nEnjoy a delicious Lao-style lunch at Makphet Restaurant. Established by Friends International (www.friends-international.org), Makphet is a charity-run restaurant aiming to train the area’s street children in the hospitality industry. Professional chefs from around the world have volunteered their time in developing the menus and training the staff. The food is excellent, and the staffs excel in bringing true Lao-hospitality in to their service.\n\nAfter lunch, drive out to Buddha Park. The drive takes around 45 minutes, along a road which serves as an important link between the Lao capital and Thailand. On the way, stop and take photos of the Friendship Bridge which was built by the Australian government in 1994 and links Laos and Thailand.\n\nArrive at Buddha Park and enjoy a stroll around the park. Also known as Xieng Khuan, this unusual park is filled with over 200 Buddhist and Hindu statues. The quiet and tranquil setting along the Mekong River is a contrast to the slightly eccentric sculptures which were built in 1958 by a Laos shaman. The concrete sculptures are bizarre but intriguing, sitting majestically in the peaceful park.\n\nAfter visiting Buddha Park, start the drive back to Vientiane. En route, stop at Mai Savanh to explore the traditional textiles of the Lao people. This shop specializes in high quality silk products and involves several families in their process, from the northern province of Luang Nam Tha Province and the southern provinces of Attapeu and Sekong. (Note: Mai Savanh is closed on Saturday &amp; Sunday)\n\nAnother stop will be made at the Lao Disabled Women Development Center. This center aims to bring knowledge and skills to disabled women so that they can become self-sufficient, productive members of the community. The center focuses its efforts on helping people with disabilities gain independence and self confidence. A visit to the center provides you with the opportunity to talk to these women and to observe their skill at creating handicrafts such as hand made paper. (Note: Subject to change without prior notice from the suppliers).\n\nEnd your tour of the capital along the banks of the Mekong River as the sun begins to set. Stroll along the river, stop to enjoy a cold drink, or sample a snack from one of the many local food stalls. This area is very popular with locals who go to exercise in the park in the evenings and you can also browse the evening market for souvenirs.\n\nTransfer back to your hotel.\n\nTime:            \t09.00 – 17.00 \nDeparture: \tDaily\n                         \nOur services include:\n- Transport in a private air-conditioned vehicle • Meals as indicated (L = Lunch).\n- 1 English Speaking Guide (for other languages supplements apply).\n- All entrance fees .\n- All permissions and local taxes\n- Drinking water\n\nOur services do not include:\n- Alcoholic drinks &amp; drinks at mealtime .\n- Personal travel insurance.\n- Visa.\n- Personal expenses\n- Tips for guide and driver\n- Meals other than those mentioned above\n- Other services not clearly indicated in the Package Inclusion above","durationSlots":2,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh0mpqivh1eqe5v/10.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CIT","localityName":"Central"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":12,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":11,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"32695LAO","productOptCode":"VTEPKEXOVTELDVTCB","rank":4,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Kayaking","Cruising","Honeymoon","Cycling"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"2588LAO","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"2588LAO","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"FD Vientiane City Tour and Buddha Park","voucherName":"EXO Travel Vientiane"}}

Continue on foot the short distance for a quick look at the overgrown Long Chau Temple or Dien Voi Re – the ‘Palace of the Crying Elephants’.  This tiny temple in crumbling disrepair is where the Emperor’s war elephants were buried and then worshipped after their demise.

From early Buddhist temples with dedications to the Bodhisattva and the Cosmological Mother to the towering Hindu structures of Prambanan – each temple offers its own unique story. This truly is a photographer’s delight with sunset views of the Prambanan complex to the Ramayana Ballet with magnificent Shiva temple as your backdrop.\n\nYour local guide and private vehicle will pick you up from your Hotel after lunch for this day’s touring of some of the best examples of ancient Buddhist and Hindu architecture in Indonesia. Start with one of the least visited temples, Candi Kalasan an 8th Century Buddhist temple thought to be dedicated to the Bodhisattva Tara and surrounded by Stupas which are the graves of Monks thought to reside at nearby Candi Sari. This temple is suggested to be the prototype for Prambanan and is unique due to the remaining stucco or plasterwork that still adorns the temple walls. \n\nNext, explore the UNESCO listed ancient Hindu temple of Prambanan. Built in the 9th century, this collection of sharp, jagged temples features three main inner shrines dedicated to the Hindu trinity: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Your guide will explain the history and symbolism of the temples as you walk around. Comprising 2 Buddhist temples cut by a road and surrounded by Rice paddies and Banana plantations Candi Plaosan Hindu temples were constructed for the wife of King Rakai Pikatan in the 9th century and also contain Buddhist elements as a tribute to his wife’s religion. Candi Sewu is an 8th Century Buddhist Temple complex and the largest in the Prambanan area. Learn more about the local legends behind the construction of this unique temple featuring over 100 'kala' heads thought to symbolise the Cosmic Mother. This temple is actually the remains of a Kraton, or Palace and located 196m above sea level. With views over Prambanan, Yogya city and Mount Merapi, Ratu Boko was built as a spiritual retreat and comprises both Buddhist and Hindu elements. Here you will enjoy a tea/coffee and a local snack as you watch the sunset for your elevated vantage point. We return to Prambanan and enjoy a spectacular performance of the Hindu epic story of King Rama on the open stage at the Temple with Prambanan illuminated as a backdrop. This version of the performance featuring over 200 dancers actually mirrors the engravings on the temple walls which has been summarized into 4 scenes and accompanied by the traditional Indonesian instrument –the Gamelan.

There are plenty of chances to interact with Yangon residents and learn more about the Burmese culture. \n\nBefore returning to Sakura Tower we’ll stop for a cup of tea or coffee at Lat Ywae Sin, a favorite tea shop with the locals. Busy from morning until night, this shop roasts its own coffee and has unique wood carvings on its wall. If you are feeling hungry, they are famous for their semolina cake and also offer great noodle dishes (drinks only; food not included).\n\nReturn to Sakura Tower around midday. If your feet are tired we recommend heading to the 6th floor for a rejuvenating foot massage performed by local blind masseurs who have been trained in traditional Japanese reflexology.

Started by a retired American publisher working with several bright and dedicated Lao college students, Big Brother Mouse started publishing “books that make literacy fun!” The books are written and illustrated by Lao writers for children to educate themselves through reading. The cost of five books is included in every Bucket of Books, with that money going directly to Big Brother Mouse.\n\nPha Tad Ke Botanical Garden is due to open in 2015 and will be the first project of its kind in Laos. Located close to Luang Prabang and on an impressive scale, the primary objective of the project is education; teaching people the importance of preserving the natural world and how to go about it. The garden will also host international botanists for various research projects. Whilst the gardens are not ready yet, the team behind them is already actively educating the people of Laos, with a focus on rural communities and children especially. The team has already published five books which are aimed at children, but will be educational for all ages. The cost of five books is included in every Bucket of Books, with that money going directly to Pha Tad Ke.\n\nThe Bucket of Books contains:\n1 x Metal bucket (used for carrying water from the well/stream and for washing)\n5 x Books from Pha Tad Ke (5 different titles, suitable for all ages, each one explaining sustainable use of local flora, with proceeds going to the charity)\n5 x Books from Big Brother Mouse (5 different titles, suitable for all ages but aimed at children, with proceeds going to the charity)\n4 x Toothbrush\n4 x Toothpaste\n4 x Bar of soap (wrapped in cardboard)\n\nWhen creating this option a major concern was that numerous clients would end up visiting the same communities and giving the same donations. To avoid or minimize this issue, EXO has have compiled a list of the 10 most suitable villages within a few hours of Luang Prabang. The villages that guests visit will not be confirmed in advance so that bookings can be managed effectively. Through these efforts we aim to ensure that the village being visited might have had a similar visit a few months before, but not a few days before.\n\nA picnic lunch, catered by l’Elephant, is included for guests to enjoy in the countryside.\n\nGuests will return to their hotel in Luang Prabang in the mid-afternoon (timings will vary depending on which village they visit and how long is spent there).\n\nTime: 09.00 – 17.0009.00 – 17.00\nDeparture: Daily\nNote: \n1. We suggest that items are handed to parents, teachers or the village chief where possible, rather than directly to children, in an effort to avoid encouraging begging.\n2. If you are travelling further off the beaten track in Laos then you can choose to simply purchase a Bucket of Books ($80 per bucket) and take it with you to distribute elsewhere on your itinerary.\n\nOur services include:\n-Transfers from/to your hotel by shared VIP minibus (provided by Shangri-Lao with English speaking guide).\n-1 English Speaking Guide (for other languages supplements apply).\n- Meals as indicated (L = Lunch).\n- All entrance fees as mentioned.\n-All permissions and local taxes\n\nOur services do not include:\n- Personal expenses (tips, additional refreshments, souvenirs etc).\n- Personal travel insurance .\n-Meals other than those mentioned above • Other services not clearly indicated in the Package Inclusion above.","durationSlots":2,"guideLanguage":"English","images":[{"description":"","title":"","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/pnugzifokspqy6g/3.jpg?raw=1"}],"isPreferred":true,"isPromotion":false,"locality":{"localityCode":"CIT","localityName":"Central"},"pax":{"adults":{"ageFrom":13,"ageTo":99,"allowed":true},"children":{"ageFrom":2,"ageTo":12,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":true},"infants":{"ageFrom":0,"ageTo":1,"allowed":true,"countInPaxBreak":false}},"productId":"35562LAO","productOptCode":"LPQPKEXOLPQFDBBEG","rank":62,"sType":"non-accommodation","styles":["Wellness & Spirit"],"supplier":{"supplierId":"6161LAO","supplierName":"EXO Travel"},"supplierId":"6161LAO","timeSlots":{"Afternoon":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"1700","pickupTime":"1100"},"Evening":{"available":false,"dropoffTime":"2300","pickupTime":"1700"},"Morning":{"available":true,"dropoffTime":"1300","pickupTime":"0700"}},"title":"FD Bucket of Books","voucherName":"EXO Travel Luang Prabang"}}

From early Buddhist temples with dedications to the Bodhisattva and the Cosmological Mother to the towering Hindu structures of Prambanan – each temple offers its own unique story. This truly is a photographer’s delight with sunset views of the Prambanan complex to the Ramayana Ballet with magnificent Shiva temple as your backdrop.\n\nYour local guide and private vehicle will pick you up from your Hotel after lunch for this day’s touring of some of the best examples of ancient Buddhist and Hindu architecture in Indonesia. Start with one of the least visited temples, Candi Kalasan an 8th Century Buddhist temple thought to be dedicated to the Bodhisattva Tara and surrounded by Stupas which are the graves of Monks thought to reside at nearby Candi Sari. This temple is suggested to be the prototype for Prambanan and is unique due to the remaining stucco or plasterwork that still adorns the temple walls. \n\nNext, explore the UNESCO listed ancient Hindu temple of Prambanan. Built in the 9th century, this collection of sharp, jagged temples features three main inner shrines dedicated to the Hindu trinity: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Your guide will explain the history and symbolism of the temples as you walk around. Comprising 2 Buddhist temples cut by a road and surrounded by Rice paddies and Banana plantations Candi Plaosan Hindu temples were constructed for the wife of King Rakai Pikatan in the 9th century and also contain Buddhist elements as a tribute to his wife’s religion. Candi Sewu is an 8th Century Buddhist Temple complex and the largest in the Prambanan area. Learn more about the local legends behind the construction of this unique temple featuring over 100 'kala' heads thought to symbolise the Cosmic Mother. This temple is actually the remains of a Kraton, or Palace and located 196m above sea level. With views over Prambanan, Yogya city and Mount Merapi, Ratu Boko was built as a spiritual retreat and comprises both Buddhist and Hindu elements. Here you will enjoy a tea/coffee and a local snack as you watch the sunset for your elevated vantage point. We return to Prambanan and enjoy a spectacular performance of the Hindu epic story of King Rama on the open stage at the Temple with Prambanan illuminated as a backdrop.

With this Bagan day trip you will come to realize the true beauty of Myanmar: its people and landscapes.\n\nThis morning your guide will greet you at the hotel. Transfer to the Irrawaddy River jetty where the boat is waiting (bikes and helmets will also be here). A short ferry ride takes you across the waterway to the western banks of the river where it’s time to start pedaling.\n\nFrom the jetty we’ll embark on the first leg of our journey to Myitche, a typical Irrawaddy River village with many cottage industries. We’ll stop for a visit at the morning market, a huge, colorful market selling everything from fresh goods to handicrafts. This is a very local market and the vendors will be surprised to see tourists as very few go. There are many delicious treats being made, a good chance to try the local snacks. Nearby there is a small village where the locals weave house wares from rattan (or cane) and we will make a short stop there to see the production.\n\nThen we start on the road to Pakkoku, a 40 kilometer ride that is flat and mostly on sealed tarmac. There are large trees providing partial shade and very few cars on the road, only the occasional cyclist, motorbike or ox cart. The land in this area is extremely fertile and the road is lined with fields growing tobacco, cotton, chili and peanuts. Depending on the time of year the locals may be planting, harvesting or processing the crops and there are plenty of chances to stop and interact with the local farmers.\n\nWe’ll arrive in Pakkoku at midday and stop for lunch in a local restaurant.\n\nAfter the morning’s adventure, it’s time to take a break from the midday heat and cruise back down the Irrawaddy River by private boat (approximately 2 hours).

This tour is lead by the villagers of Ban Hatkhai village and aims to improve their well-being, as well as to increase their incomes. At the same time, the Orchid Trek offers a tool for environmental and cultural awareness as well as encouraging orchid preservation and conservation by involving several stakeholders:\nThe villagers: acting as the tour guides, and providing services such as activities and food. \nYou: You are not only a spectator but also a participant, interacting with the locals and the environment.\nFor each tour, a part of the money goes directly to the villagers and the village development fund.

The Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and officially designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, covering an area of around 250,000 hectares in the dry season. Due to a unique phenomenon, when the monsoon begins, the swollen waters of the Mekong River force the Tonle Sap River to reverse its flow northwards, feeding the Great Lake and spreading over the surrounding flood plain.\n\nBoard a local boat and visit the village of Kompong Khleang, where only few tourists venture. Embark on a boat ride through the village where the fisherman and their families live in stilted houses among the petrified mangrove forests and waterways. Enjoy the fascinating scenery of Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake. (Note: during the months Apr-Sep the water level may be too low for a visit by boat. However the village is still fascinating and can be visited by car. Quite dramatic to see how the stilted houses are exposed from lake when water levels are low!)\n\nEnjoy a packed lunch at one of the local houses as you watch everyday life at the village.\n\nAfter lunch head to the quiet Beng Mealea, around 65 km from Siem Reap.

Visit three stupas where many years ago sacred Buddha relics, brought from India, were enshrined by two merchant brothers. Join local pilgrims on this fascinating spiritual journey.\n\nYour guide and driver will greet you at your hotel to embark on your Pilgrimage Tour. Legend states that 2000 years ago two merchant brothers traveled from Yangon to India with 8 holy hairs from Gottama Buddha. Along the way several were stolen yet the King in Yangon placed the remaining 4 relics in a special box and they miraculously replicated to the original number. This auspicious occasion was followed by the enshrinement of the hairs.\n\nFirst you’ll visit Botataung Pagoda. The 40-metre high golden pagoda is an impressive site from the outside and inside there is a mini museum displaying many interesting items including the sacred relic of legend. This is the site where the brothers arrived back in Yangon, greeted by the king and his soldiers. Botataung means ‘1000 soldiers’ and was built by one of the brothers specifically to house this relic.\n\nDrive toward central downtown, where you can drive or take a short walking tour past the colonial-style buildings such as the Post Office and Strand Hotel, to Mahabandoola Park and Sule Paya. \n\nSule Paya is located in the centre of downtown and is an octagonal Mon-style pagoda. Throughout the day Sule Paya is busy with local pilgrims and monks who come to pray and pay their respects to the Buddha relic, placed here by descendants of the second brother.\n\nFinally you’ll visit Shwedagon Pagoda, where the remaining relics were enshrined.

This can be done for couples alone or with family and friends present (price on request).\n\nYou are picked up by guide and driver this afternoon (exact pick up time can be found below) and brought to the Tegenungan waterfall for taking holy water from the spring which will be used for the ceremony. \nFor doing this ritual, a sarong and sash will be provided to you.

Arrive at the Balinese compound where you are dressed up with traditional Balinese wedding costumes, including make-up.\nWhen all ready you will offer ‘segehan’, a small offering made up with rice at the home entrance to officially start off the ceremony.\nAround 18:00 is the main wedding ritual. You will perform the ceremony of mebayuh and mebiakala which are purported to cleanse the physical and spiritual body as well as preparing the couple to enter life in matrimony. During this ceremony, traditional music called Gender (Gamelan) will be played.  \nFrom here you will proceed to a building called ‘Bale Gede’ for the next step of the ritual. This is where you will pray for a happy, blessed, and long-lasting marriage life. The ritual will be followed by a photo session.\nAfter that you will be brought by a Megayot, a wedding procession where you will mount onto a palanquin supported by four people each and march to the entertainment and dining area.  \nAround 20:00, a typical Balinese dinner will be served, along with a bottle of local wine. \nA professional photographer will take part of the documentation from arriving at the Tegenungan waterfall.

Located along 86th Street in downtown Mandalay, the market is rarely visited by tourist, making it one of the few markets in Southeast Asia where an authentic experience can still be found. The traders are here to conduct serious business and pay little attention to camera-toting foreigners. Myanmar’s jade trade dates back thousands of years. The country is the only place in the world where Imperial Jade, coveted by China, is found. Mandalay’s Jade Market is a congregation of Myanmar, Chinese, Indian and Thai traders.\n\nAfter breakfast your guide will pick you up at the hotel to get started on an incredible morning. Transfer to 86th street for a walking tour of the surrounding streets. Mandalay has become a bustling city as it is strategically located in the northern Myanmar, nearby the ruby, gold and jade mines. This position has allowed the jade industry to flourish as merchants from China, India and Thailand coalesce. Afterwards we will visit the market, discovering white, yellow and green jade. The precious gem can be found in all forms, from its raw, unpolished state to beautiful handcrafted jewelry. Watch as skilled craftsman cut and polish the stone on wet saws and sellers and buyers haggle over price. Our visit coincides with the busiest time of the day at the jade market.

After your meal and according to availability (optional extra) you may be lucky enough to catch a performance at the Saigon Opera House.

From the restaurant, stroll down Dong Khoi street past iconic landmarks such as the Saigon Opera House, the former Hotel De Ville which is superbly designed dating back to 1908 and the Rex Hotel where the derogatorily named ‘five o clock follies’ took place each day during the ‘American War’ as it is known in Vietnam.

A visit to Kyaukhtatgyi provides a great overview of Buddhism with murals depicting the life of Buddha, the feet of the statue carved with traditional symbols and often many locals gathering to pay homage and pray.\n\nContinue to a local tea shop for a chance to experience an integral part of Burmese life: drinking tea! Select from an array of snacks and enjoy a coffee or tea as you sit amid businessmen, friends and families who gather at the tea shop to socialize or conduct business.\n\nNext your guided tour goes to Kandawagyi Park, one of central Yangon’s greenest spots. Here you will see the glittering Karaweik barge, a replica of the royal barge, and the vast lake with views of Shwedagon in the background. Depending on the day of your visit Kandawgyi may be busy with local families who come here on the weekend to relax in the fresh air.\n\nFrom here, continue to Shwedagon Pagoda the most revered Buddhist temple in Myanmar. Although the origins of the pagoda are unclear, the local legend states that the original structure was built 2500 years ago then renovated several times until taking its current shape in the 15th century. The 8-sided central stupa is 99 meters tall and gilded with gold leaf and is surrounded by 64 smaller stupas and your guide will show you around the massive complex, explaining why this temple is so revered. Enjoy breathtaking views of the golden stupa from this vantage point.

After passing through a small entrance hole you descend 100 meters into the ground. However, the cave widens once inside, where a reclining Buddha statue welcomes visitors to a place once serving as the home to bats, gibbons, monkeys, and antelope. Tham Pou Kham displays several wet rock formations including a pair of \"Golden Crabs\". After exploring the cavern, you might like to go for a cold swim in the Ka River's water hole. The water is clean, deep, and safe for jumping in if you feeling brave, before transferring south to your next stop.\n\nConsidered by many as Vang Vieng's most important cave, Tham Chang (or Jang) became the home for migrating people, who settled near the town's southern Meuang Xong Village to raise vegetables. The locals stumbled into the cavern during a civil war, while seeking refuge deep in the forest. Because its high location offered perfect views of Vang Vieng, the entire village moved there to sit out the war, and named their haven 'Tham Jang' (Hang Around Cave). Years later during the colonial era, the locals returned to cultivating the nearby fields and would bathe in the cave's basin, where the water was so cold they said it could freeze your legs to a firm stiffness. They then adjusted the cave's name to 'Tham Chang', which means \"unable to move\", leaving locals no choice but to \"hang around\"! Inside you will find spectacular stalactites and stalagmites and a viewpoint offers an impressive panorama. Once you climb back down you have the option to swim in the natural spring water.\n\nTake a local longtail boat (2 people per boat) to cruise for approximately 1 hour upstream on the Nam Song River, enjoying the beautiful scenery as you go.\n\nArrive at the extensive Organic Farm, which specializes in refreshing mulberry tea as well as having a range of livestock and organic crops.

From this stunning village, and with Gunung Merapi as the backdrop, set off by bike on a 15km, mostly downhill ride. As you pass through the various villages and countryside you will have plenty of opportunities to stop for photos or chat to the locals. Your guide will also show you the locals engaged in various activities such as tobacco, rice and snake fruit plantations and explain the agriculture processes of growing and harvesting these native crops. After 15 km you will take lunch in a local restaurant where your hard work is rewarded with a magnificent view of Prambanan in the distance. \n\nAfter lunch you will be driven to the huge Prambanan complex, a set of temples built in the middle of the 9th century, about 50 years after the construction of Borobudur. There is very little early history about the complex but it is thought to have been constructed to commemorate the return of a Hindu dynasty to Java. The temples lay in ruins for hundreds of years and it was only in the 1930s that reconstruction was started. Now most of the temples within the complex have been restored. Your guide will take you around the temple grounds explaining a bit about the history, building process and religious significance of these buildings.

She was born during the time Pol Pot was in power and schools were not available. \n\nDuring this time her grandfather, Loung Sake, was the Grand Abbot of the Angkor complex and this is where she lived. It is unusual for a girl to be educated by monks, but as granddaughter she enjoyed that privilege and lived in the Wat Angkor Kang Chuong (Angkor Wat Pagoda). Under his guidance the monks at Angkor educated her in Sanskrit scriptures on bamboo scrolls, elaborate prayers and rites. Later when schools started to become available in town she traveled the many miles to claim her daily education.\n\nOriginally her family was a substantial landowner at the Angkor area and one of the tour stops is at the land where she grew up.\n\nAfter this you will proceed and pass by a shop selling colorful small house temples. Here it is explained why so many Khmer houses have such temples outside and what they mean. \n\nThen you will stop at a small local market that is only a few minutes’ drive to get a feel for the atmosphere and what is on offer.\n\nAfter the market proceed ultimately over a country path to the parameter dike of Baray lake. There you will get off the bikes and walk for approx. 1 minute to overcome a small climb. From proceed on the embankment of the West Baray Lake.\n\nFollowing the embankment we arrive at a Chinese cemetery of the Wat Svai Romiet Pagoda and enjoy the beautiful view of the lake and see the difference in the Khmer and the Gregorian calendar.

This city is surrounded by an 8 m high wall, drawing a perfect square. Enter the city through the ancient South Gate, an impressive stone gate carved with Elephants and four giant faces. On each side of the entrance path a row of 54 gods or demons is holding the sacred Naga snake.\n\nFrom here, continue to Bayon Temple in the exact center of the city. This 12th century masterpiece is a study in grandeur and is well-known for its 54 towers with enigmatic faces representing the 54 provinces of the Great Khmer Empire. The Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper King are also must-visits as they are both known for their intricate bas-reliefs.\n\nTake a break for lunch (at own expense), before you continue to Ta Prohm. Ta Prohm is unique in that it has been left largely as it was found: overgrown by jungle trees and vines, with many parts of the temple crumbling to the ground. This makes the ‘Tomb Raider Temple’ one of the most picturesque and memorable of the Angkor temples.\n\nNow you are ready for the highlight: The magnificent Angkor Wat. Built during the reign of King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century, Angkor Wat is constructed following the model of the temple mountain symbolizing Mount Meru, the home of the gods. Inside the temple, the walls are covered with stone carvings and bas-reliefs depicting Hindu mythology and the wars Suryavarman II fought during his reign. Angkor Wat is well known for the more than 2,000 Apsara dancers decorating the temple. Construction is thought to have taken around thirty years of intensive labor. Today, Angkor Wat is figured on Cambodia's national flag as the temple symbolizes the soul of the Khmer people.\n\nYou will be there during sunset time, when Angkor Wat is less visited and the Apsaras will shine in the most beautiful light.

Many of the buildings visited are on the Yangon City Heritage List, a list of 188 man-made structures mainly consisting of religious landmarks and colonial-era buildings.\n\nHighlights include City Hall, the old railway station and the former Minister’s office where General Aung San was assassinated. Interspersed in the guided walk are various religious sites such as the St Mary’s Cathedral, built in 1899, and the Buddhist landmarks of Sule Paya and Botataung Pagoda.\n\nBy walking through the streets you’ll also have a chance to witness the lifestyles of the locals- from the busy bus and boat stations to the tea shops and hidden street markets. There are plenty of chances to interact with Yangon residents and learn more about the Burmese culture.\n\nNext we’ll stop for a cup of tea or coffee at Lat Ywae Sin, a favorite tea shop with the locals. Busy from morning until night, this shop roasts its own coffee and has unique wood carvings on its wall. If you are feeling hungry, they are famous for their semolina cake and also offer great noodle dishes (drinks only; food not included).\n\nIf your feet are tired we recommend heading to the 6th floor of Sakura Tower for a rejuvenating foot massage performed by local blind masseurs who have been trained in traditional Japanese reflexology.

Also a visit to a unique Balinese village and of course a temple is part of today’s itinerary.\n\nThis morning you are picked up by the driver and tour guide for a fascinating tour. We start with a visit to Tegalalang where we have views over arguably the most beautiful rice terraces in Bali. We drive a bit further to Sebatu where we visit a working coffee plantation. This plantation doesn’t only have coffee but other fruits and species such as cocoa, clove, vanilla, cinnamon, passion fruit and many others... \n\nAfter a short walk through the plantation you will be shown the fruits, the processing and of course the roasting process. Here they still roast the beans in a traditional wok over a wood fire like they have been doing for many generations. Afterwards you are all going to get a taste of freshly made coffee from the freshest roasted beans imaginable. We also have a cup of the famous and exclusive Kopi Luwak. This mix of Robusta and Arabica coffee beans has been eaten and passed through the digestive track of the Indonesian Civet cat which gives it its distinct flavour, highly regarded by coffee lovers all over the world. When your curiosity is satisfied the trip continues further to the north to Kintamani. Upon arrival at Kintamani, stop for lunch at a local restaurant where you will enjoy spectacular views over Lake Batur and its volcano, Mt Batur. Although Mt Batur (1412m) is not the highest volcano in Bali, it is the most active and is surrounded by an impressive caldera.
